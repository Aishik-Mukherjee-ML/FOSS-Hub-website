## Guidelines for contributing

The OpenSource Team and Development Team at MapleLabs welcome contributions to this repository.

If you'd like to to make code contributions, or make content contributions locally, follow the contribution guidelines below.

## Getting started

### Local development

You can serve this site locally to quickly see your changes and additions before you PR them. To get started, navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up, as follows.

```shell
cd opensource-portal/
yarn
yarn start
```

Your site is now running at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)!

The first time you build the site locally, it will take upwards of 5 minutes. This is normal, and will take signifigantly less time afterwards.

### Dependencies

Node v18 is used in this project as specified in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website/blob/master/.nvmrc).

### Cloning vs forking

To be able to [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository and contribute you will need to be given write access to the repository. Contact the MapleLabs Development team if you need write access. Permission for write access is reserved with MapleLabs.

To contribute without write access, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository and contribute as needed. If you're planning to leave a fork open for a long time (for example, you're working on a complex set of changes), [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) occasionally to avoid merge conflicts.
